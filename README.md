# Dijkstra Algorithm Game

## What is Dijkstra Algorithm:
- This algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The Dijkstra algorithm begins with a node and checks its neighbours, adding their neighbours to the queue. 


### What does the code do:
In this, You draw grey walls using the left mouse click. This causes the algorithm queue to stop and the queued nodes to go around the barriers.

What happens if there is a surrounding wall around the end node  ?
